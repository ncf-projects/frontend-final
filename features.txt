Features To Implement:

NCF Portal: Relevant Links
State: Ignored
I ended up not redoing the portal par request, as it wasn't really in scope of the project.

Course List: Sort By Keyword
State: Implemented
You can start typing the name of a class or major in the search bar, and results will show up.
Example, typing 'art' will show up all classes that have 'art' as their subject.

Course List: Improved Dropdowns
State: Implemented
Instead of several different dropdowns, the site now has a single dropdown that shows all the options.

Student Evaluation System: Top Nav-Bar
State: Implemented
There's now a top nav bar that spreads across all pages.

Work Request: Add a way to submit a request anonymously
State: Ignored
This wasn't in the scope of the project, ended up not doing the Work Request site.

Student Evaluation System: Overview
State: Implemented
The site now has a page that shows all of the evaluations for a given term.

Course List: Class Grid View
State: Implemented
When searching for classes, the site utilizes a grid view for the results. Results will stack and to ocupy as much
space as possible.

Course List: Search Forums
State: Implemented
When searching for classes, the site will update and append/remove the results as you go.

Course List: Buttons for class modifiers
State: Implemented
You can select radio buttons to see what dates you'd like to see classes for.

Course List: Class Time Selection
State: Unimplemented
I didn't end up Implementing this because I had no easy way of collecting the times for each class, and
the amount of JS this would take would've been overwhelming.
